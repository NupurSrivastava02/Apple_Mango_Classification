### Aim and Objective
## Aim
### To create a fruit detection system which detects objects based on whether it is an apple or a mango.
## Objective
### The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson Nano or any PC with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera module on the device.
### Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.
### To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module whether objects are apple or mango.
## Abstract
### An object is classified based on whether it is a mango or an apple and is detected by the live feed from the systemâ€™s camera.
### We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.
### A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.
### One such technique is to utilize YOLOv5 with the Roboflow model, which generates a small-size trained model and makes ML integration easier.
